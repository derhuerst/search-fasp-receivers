# search-fasp-receivers

**Search for [Friendly Audio Streaming Protocol](https://github.com/derhuerst/friendly-audio-streaming-protocol) receivers in the local network.**

*Note*: `search-fasp-receivers` works only in Node, because it needs access to [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) to find the receivers.

## Installing

```shell
npm install search-fasp-receivers
```


## Usage

```js
const search = require('search-fasp-receivers')

const timeout = 5 * 1000

search.byName('alice-fasp-receiver', timeout, (err, service) => {
	if (err) console.error(err)
	else console.log('found', service.host, service.port)
})
```

If you know the ID of a receiver, it is safer to search using this instead of the name:

```js
search.byId('86af5e4a3c62635d', timeout, (err, service) => {
	// â€¦
})
```
